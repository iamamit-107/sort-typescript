# sort-typescript

## In this project we explore some usecases of typescript in real life. First we implement a sort class which can sort only number. Then we refactoring this so that it can sort string and linked list also. Then we make a type guard for the sorter class so that it can maintain reuseablity. For that we use interface and declare the method it can take to sort a thing. After that, we refactor our code a little bit. We use class inheritance and make our sorter class as abstract. And it make our code more splicity.
